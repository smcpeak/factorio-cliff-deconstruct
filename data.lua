-- This line says that the proxy can be created from the cliff-explosive item.
-- Thus, when we create a ghost of a proxy, it informs nearby robots they need
-- to retrieve a cliff-explosive item, carry it to the spot, and then consume
-- it in order to build the proxy.  All of that just uses the normal blueprint
-- construction logic once the association is established.
--
-- Then, when the proxy is built by a robot, code in control.lua converts it
-- into an explosion that destroys the cliffs.
--
-- The "cliff-explosive" inventory item happens to be in the "capsule" category
-- in data.raw because it is deployed by throwing.
--
-- This also makes the game regard cliff-explosives as a thing that can be
-- placed into the world.  That in turn has three interesting effects:
--
-- 1. The player can click nearby to place one.  In that case, code in control.lua
-- immediately "refunds" the explosives, so it appears that nothing happened.
--
-- 2. The player can shift-click anywhere to place a proxy ghost.  Robots will
-- then try to build it, either destoying cliffs there or refunding the explosive.
--
-- 3. When holding cliff-explosives in hand, the icon is partially transparent
-- when beyond build distance, indicating that ordinary placement is impossible
-- but shift-clicking is.  This is unfortunate, as that distance is irrelevant
-- and potentially confusing, since ordinary clicking on cliffs is still possible,
-- per the "capsule" behavior aspect, if within the capsule deployment radius.
